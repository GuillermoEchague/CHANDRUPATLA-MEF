            'EXAMPLES' Directory
              
-  Each data file in the 'EXAMPLES' directory
   has the same title as the corresponding
   program, with an extension 'INP'
   
-  To create a data file for a problem follow
   the steps given below:
   
      1. Copy the example data file into the
         directory where the program resides
         
      2. Edit the file with the new data while
         following the same format
         
      3. Save the file giving it a different
         name
         
      4. The stage is now set for running the
         program
   
-  A data file may be created using MESHGEN 
   and/or DATAFEM.  Please compare the generated
   file with the example file to check the format
   
-  Data file for HEAT1D2 needs to be prepared
   using the file editing method.  Please compare
   and edit data files created for HEAT2D2 and 
   TORSION2 generated from using MESHGEN/DATAFEM.
