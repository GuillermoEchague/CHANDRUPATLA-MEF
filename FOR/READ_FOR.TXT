               'FOR' Directory
              
-  Source codes in FORTRAN for programs
   supporting Chapters 2 through 11 are in
   this directory
   
-  All FORTRAN programs were compiled and
   tested using FORTRAN77 and other compilers
   
-  Array dimensions have been fixed at some
   values to enable solution of small problems
   
-  Look carefully at the array dimensions and
   match them in the subroutines while attemting
   larger problems
   
-  The programs work with common data files
   given in the examples directory
   
-  The example data file for a specific program
   has the same title with a different extension
   
-  Input files may be created using the BASIC
   programs of Chapter 12
   
-  The output files for 2-D problems are compatible
   with the postprocessing programs of Chapter 12
