    FEATURES:

      . All programs from Ch 3 to 12 have been revised to use File input.
      . There is an example data file for each program. This file has a
          simple structure and it can be edited for preparing data for
          other problems.
      . DATAFEM2 is made more efficient and user-friendly.
          It can now create data for all structural programs.
          Also handles Multi-point Constraints of the type B1*Qi+B2*Qj=B3.
      . Multi-point constraints of the type B1*Qi+B2*Qj=B3 can now
          be handled in all the static analysis programs.
      . Temperature effect has been introduced in BAR, CST, AXISYM,
          QUAD, TETRA, and HEXA elements. Element temperature change
          can be handled.
      . Plane Stress/Plane Strain Condition is now a choice.
      . CST and AXISYM programs are modified to provide the choice
          for plotting data.
      . New programs are CGSOL, FRAME3D, HEXAFNT, BESTFITQ, CONTOUR2.
      . The PLOT2D2 program now plots on EGA screen.
      . The CONTOUR programs provide color contours.
      . In the Hexahedral element the four nodes of a face 1-2-3-4
          go around the boundary. 5-6-7-8 forms the parallel face and
          1-2-3-4 is counterclockwise seen from the parallel face.
      . Progams HGLCONV.BAS and DXFCONV.BAS included in the disk will
          enable the user to convert the graphics for handling on other
          CAD systems and Word Processors.
      . FORTRAN and C source codes of all the programs for Chapter 1 
          through 11 are included in the disk in separate directories.
      . All data files are in the EXAMPLES directory.  The data file
        has the program name with .INP extension.


    MAIN VARIABLES

      . All programs use the variables defined below:

        NN  -----  Number of Nodes
        NE  -----  Number of Elements
        NM  -----  Number of Different Materials
        NDIM  ---  Number of Coordinates per Node 
                   (e.g. NDIM = 2 for 2D)
        NEN  ----  Number of Nodes per Element
                   (e.g. NEN = 3 for CST Elem)
        NDN  ----  Number of Degrees of Freedom per Node 
                   (e.g. NDN = 2 for BEAM)
        ND  -----  Number of Specified Displacement Degrees of Freedom(DOF)
        NL  -----  Number of Applied Component Loads (Along DOF directions)
        NCH  ----  Number of Element Characteristics like Area and Temperature
                     rise in BAR or TRUSS, Thickness and Temperature rise in 
                     CST and so on.  Area, Moment of Inertia, Temperature 
                     Rise etc are treated as Element Characteristics
        NPR  ----  Number of Material Properties (e.g. E, nu, alpha)
        NMPC  ---  Number of MultiPoint Constraints

        The consistent use of variables will be of help to the user.


    The user convenience has been the main consideration in the 
    preparation of the programs for the Second Edition. With these
    available programs, learning Finite Elements should be fun.
